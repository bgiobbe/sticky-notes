# sticky-notes-app
Create, edit, delete, search persistent notes, which are stored in browser data.

I created this javascript/react project with CodeSandbox.io as part of Skillcrush's INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT REACT class.
Given an image of the user interface, I decomposed it into components, set up the data model and state, passed data as props to the components, wrote callbacks and JSX.

Later I downloaded it to my local machine, added background, improved style of heading, and put under git control.

Enjoy!
